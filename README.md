# portfolio


In this project I will create my portfolio in which I will reflect a bit of my design style, some projects done in class and I will test my ability to develop pages with HTML and CSS.

Step by step:

To create this project, the first thing I did was organize the information and create a step-by-step list with the stages to follow. First it was to organize the information and the images, then I started to translate the HTML code of the hi-fi prototypes, then I created the CSS code and finally I validated the CSS and HTML code.

Challenges:

One of the biggest challenges during the project was to be able to achieve the exact result regarding the hi-fi prototype. For this reason, adjustments had to be made during the project.

In order to overcome all these obstacles it is very important to have patience and tolerance for frustration, you have to try things a thousand times until it works or in certain cases see code examples of how other people solved similar problems.

Learning:

In the elaboration of this project I was able to learn to use flexbox in a more efficient way.Moreover, I corrected some mistakes that I made in other exercises, such as creating a CSS file for each page and not using alt atribute for images.
